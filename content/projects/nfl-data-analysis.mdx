This project aims to analyze historical betting data from the NFL to create insights
and trends that inform betting strategies. By using statistical analysis, we seek to
identify patterns in performance, betting, and outcomes to provide actionable insights
for users.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection:** Gather/scrape comprehensive datasets including historical game results and betting odds

- **Data Cleaning:** Conduct statistical analysis to visualize trends in betting, team performance, and the 
relationship between odds and game outcomes
- **Strategy Development:** Formulate betting strategies based on historical insights

## Methodology

- Utilize Python (specifically Pandas) and Tableau for data scraping, data analysis, and data visualization
- Create a section of code that takes inputs (conditions, results, stats) and provides a look at trends in historical data
- Displays trends based on historica game statistics, as well as subsequent results
- Insights for bettors aimed at improving their chances of success in NFL betting

## Impact

By providing analysis of NFL betting data, this project will provide bettors with the tools and insights to make informed 
decisions, ultimately enhancing their betting experience and potential profitability

## Example Trend

The following is an example output for a condition that we want to evaluate. In this case, we wanted to see how many 
games with a betting total of 46.5 - 47.5 resulted in the Over/Under hitting Under. Also, the average home team passing 
yards was shown.

## Example Visualization

The following visualization displays the relation between home team points and pass yards per game, 
and the betting spread (by season). It has adjustable filters for the betting spread and overall total, 
so as to see the different outcomes depending on the user's preferred parameters.
