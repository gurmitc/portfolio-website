## Objectives

- **Create A Simple Interface**

- **Create React Components**

- **Use React Hooks**

- **Style with CSS**

## Methodology

The Journal Entry Tracker app is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It follows
modern React practices such as functional components and hooks.

- **React State Management:** The app uses React's useState hook to manage the state of the journal entry form.

- **Form Handling:** Users can add new journal entries via a simple form, and existing entries can be deleted.

## Impact

By providing an app to log issues and fixes, team members have a resource to help better understand future issues.
